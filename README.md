# adoAPI.github.io
* This works as a response provider to a Youtube API query for a desktop app. (pretty ineffecient - but I was a beginner)
* It's a helper site : for the music feature of aDo (aDo: Another one of my project - made with java)

[Hosted Site](https://maruf22-dev.github.io/adoAPI.github.io/API.html) : Terribly Styled, as it is not meant for clinet-side use. 

* uses the Youtube api
  - Either takes an API key
  - Or, Uses random key from the stored keys
